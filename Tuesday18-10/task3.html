    <h1> Meet Jack</h1>
    <img src="jack.gif" alt="Jack">
    <p> This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's a little disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few things in the box.

        Jack would really like...
        <ul>
            <li> Roller blades</li>
            <li>Magic tricks</li>
            <li>Anything Pokemon</li>
            <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>You can get all this ( and more ) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="https://www.toysrus.com/">toysrus.com</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EToys.com">eToys</a>.
